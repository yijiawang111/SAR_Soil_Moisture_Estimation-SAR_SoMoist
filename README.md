# SAR-SoMoist V1.0  
**A High-Resolution Soil Moisture Retrieval and Mapping Software with SAR and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Datasets**  

## Introduction  
SAR-SoMoist is an integrated software tool for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval and mapping, utilizing both **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** and **passive microwave remote sensing datasets**. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for:  
- Data import  
- Pseudo-color rendering  
- Soil moisture inversion  
- Time series analysis  
- Result export  

Designed for **research, agriculture, and environmental monitoring** applications.
